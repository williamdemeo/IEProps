**Title:** *Interval enforceable properties of finite groups*

**Abstract:** We propose a classification of group properties according to whether they can be deduced from the assumption that a group's subgroup lattice contains an interval isomorphic to some lattice. We are able to classify a few group properties as being "interval enforceable" in this sense, and we establish that other properties satisfy a weaker notion of "core-free interval enforceable."  We also show that if there exists a group property and its negation that are both core-free interval enforceable, this would settle an important open question in universal algebra.


The paper has been accepted and is in the final editorial stages. It should
appear in print sometime in 2014.  The latest revision is in the tex directory.
