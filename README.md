This repository contains an article that had been provisionally accepted for
publication pending revisions.  However, after revising and resubmitting the manuscript, I
noticed that I had introduced some serious flaws.  I am now withdrawing the
submission, and plan to publish the corrected version.

The latest revision is in the tex directory of this repository.

**Title:** *Interval enforceable properties of finite groups*  
**Author:** William DeMeo [@williamdemeo](https://github.com/williamdemeo)  

**Abstract:** We propose a classification of group properties according to
  whether they can be deduced from the assumption that a group's subgroup
  lattice contains an interval isomorphic to some lattice. We are able to
  classify a few group properties as being "interval enforceable" in this sense,
  and we establish that other properties satisfy a weaker notion of "core-free
  interval enforceable."  We also show that if there exists a group property and
  its negation that are both core-free interval enforceable, this would settle
  an important open question in universal algebra.
