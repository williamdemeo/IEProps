**Title:** *Interval enforceable properties of finite groups*

**Abstract:** We propose a classification of group properties according to whether they can be deduced from the assumption that a group's subgroup lattice contains an interval isomorphic to some lattice. We are able to classify a few group properties as being ``interval enforceable'' in this sense, and we establish that other properties satisfy a weaker notion of ``core-free interval enforceable.''  We also show that if there exists a group property and its negation that are both core-free interval enforceable, this would settle an important open question in universal algebra.


The paper has been accepted and is in the final editorial stages. It should
